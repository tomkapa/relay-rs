//! Per-agent language lookup used by the system-prompt assembler.
//!
//! Sits between two stores so the agent worker doesn't have to: given an
//! [`AgentId`], find the agent's `org_id` (via [`SharedAgentStore`]),
//! then read that org's `default_language` (via [`SharedUserStore`]).
//! A bounded TTL cache makes the hot path cheap — every Normal turn
//! calls [`OrgLanguageResolver::language_for_agent`] before rendering the
//! `<language>` tag, but `(agent → org_id)` and `(org → language)` change
//! rarely.
//!
//! Cache invalidation. The cache is keyed by [`AgentId`] (the only thing
//! the caller has). Org-language changes are rare (an admin clicking the
//! language switcher), so the PATCH route calls
//! [`OrgLanguageResolver::invalidate_all`] rather than scanning entries
//! for the matching org — simpler and bounded.
